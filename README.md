Hello, I'm not sure what I'm doing here, in multiple senses of the statement.  Maybe I'll go get ice cream later.

I don't know whether or not I got ice cream that day.  But it's two years later, and I'm still hanging in there somehow.

Still following the tutorial here, in good ol' 2020, having a great time.  Uhhhh my favorite colors are blue and grey and pink and orange?  And peridot.  But whenever I try to type 'peridot' I accidentally type 'period' and have to backspace.
